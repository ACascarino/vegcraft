# VegCraft

A Minecraft datapack for the creation of purely vegan recipes!
All original recipes remain in the game - these are simply in addition.
Here's the complete set of recipes, as of v0.2-pre:

Item | Recipe | Description
---- | ------ | ----------
Black Dye | ![Stonecutter: Charcoal -> 2 black dye](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/black_dye.png) | Original black dye recipe used ink sacs - in making them redundant have specified that stonecutting charcoal into powder makes black dye
Book and Quill | ![Crafting table: shapeless: book, stick, black dye -> book and quill](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/book_and_quill.png) | Original book and quill recipe used feathers and ink sac; substituted a stick and black dye for a "pen" theme
Blaze Powder | ![Crafting table: top row: glowstone dust, gold nugget, glowstone dust; middle row: nether wart, gunpowder, nether wart; bottom row: glowstone dust, gold nugget, glowstone dust -> blaze powder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/blaze_powder.png) | Original blaze powder is produced from blaze rods, a drop from Blazes - went with a "firey gold powder" theme
Blaze Rod | ![Crafting table: top row: -, gold nugget, -; middle row: blaze powder, stick, blaze powder; bottom row: -, gold nugget, - -> blaze rod](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/blaze_rod.png) | Original blaze rods are a drop from Blazes - flipped production so powder is now produced first and rods are constituted from powder.
Ender Pearl | ![Crafting table: top row: quartz, cyan dye, quartz; middle row: quartz, bottle o' enchanting, quartz; bottom row: quartz, quartz, quartz -> ender pearl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/ender_pearl.png) ![Furnace: end stone -> ender pearl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/ender_pearl_smithing.png) | Original ender pearls obtained from endermen - went for a "magic glass orb" theme. Requiring Bottles O' Enchanting forces it to be a late-game item. After you reach the End, ender pearls are plentiful, so made the smelting recipe to reflect that.
Cake | ![Crafting table: top row: 3 milk bucket; middle row: sugar, honey bottle, sugar; bottom row: 3 wheat -> cake](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/cake.png) | Original cake recipe uses eggs; have substituted eggs for honey globally
Feather | ![Crafting table: shapeless: paper, stick, string -> 4 feathers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/feather.png) | Firework star "burst" recipe hardcoded to use feathers, so needed an alternate feather recipe - getting the sense of tying paper to a stick as a "paper feather"
Ghast Tear | ![Crafting table: top row: fire charge, gunpowder, glass; middle row: blaze powder, quartz, blaze powder; bottom row: glass, gunpowder, fire charge -> Ghast Tear](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/ghast_tear.png) | Original ghast tears are obtained from killing Ghasts. They are relatively difficult to obtain, so the recipe reflects this.
Gunpowder | ![Crafting table: shapeless: redstone dust, coal, bone meal, sugar -> gunpowder](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/gunpowder.png) | Gunpowder originally obtained from creepers - went for the idea of "energetic powdery burny stuff".
Honey Bottle | ![Crafting table: top row: sugar, orange dye, sugar; middle row: orange dye, water bottle, orange dye; bottom row: sugar, orange dye, sugar -> honey bottle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/honey_bottle_1.png) ![Crafting table: top row: orange dye, sugar, orange dye; middle row: sugar, water bottle, sugar; bottom row: orange dye, sugar, orange dye -> honey bottle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/honey_bottle_2.png) | Original method of honey production uses bees; new method dyes sugary water.
Leather | ![Crafting table: shapeless: 3 rotten flesh, string -> leather](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/leather.png) | Original method of leather production kills cows; new method sews together rotten flesh to make a leather
Milk Bucket | ![Crafting table: shapeless: 3 wheat, bucket, water bucket -> milk bucket](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/milk_bucket.png) | Original method of milk production uses cows; new method creates "oat milk". Two buckets needed due to bucket duplication glitch.
Pumpkin Pie | ![Crafting table: shapeless: pumpkin, sugar, honey bottle -> pumpkin pie](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/pumpkin_pie.png) | Original pumpkin pie recipe uses eggs; have substituted eggs for honey globally
Rotten Flesh | ![Crafting table: shapeless: apple, red dye, green dye, black dye -> 2 rotten flesh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/rotten_flesh_apple.png) ![Crafting table: shapeless: poisonous potato, red dye, green dye, black dye -> 2 rotten flesh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/rotten_flesh_potato.png)| Original rotten flesh production kills zombies; have created an "apple leather" vibe with dye and crushed charcoal (black dye). Have also given use to poisonous potatos as a sort of "rotten potato leather".
String | ![Smelting: grass -> string](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/string_grass.png) ![Smelting: seagrass -> string](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/string_seagrass.png) ![Smelting: tall grass -> string](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACascarino/vegcraft/master/img/string_tallgrass.png) | Original string production kills spiders; have gone with smelted grasses as string.
